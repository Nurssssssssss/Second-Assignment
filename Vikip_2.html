                <h2>Early life and education</h2> <hr>
                <p class="p_Robert">Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on August 18, 1936,[1] in Santa Monica, California, to Martha Woodruff Redford (née Hart; 1914–1955), who was from Austin, Texas, and Charles Robert Redford Sr. (1914–1991), an accountant.[2] He had a paternal half-brother, William.[3] Redford was of Irish, Scottish, and English ancestry.[4][page needed][5][6] His patrilineal great-great-grandfather, a Protestant Englishman named Elisha Redford, married Mary Ann McCreery, of Irish Catholic descent, in Manchester, Lancashire. They immigrated to New York City in America in 1849, immediately settling next in Stonington, Connecticut. They had a son named Charles, the first in line to have been given the name. Regarding Redford's maternal lineage, the Harts were Irish from Galway and the Greens were Scotch-Irish who settled in the United States in the 18th century.[4][page needed] Redford's family lived in Van Nuys while his father worked in El Segundo. As a child, he and his family often traveled to Austin to visit his maternal grandfather. Redford credited his environmentalism and love of nature to his childhood in Texas.[7]</p> <br>
                <p class="p_Robert">Redford attended Van Nuys High School, where he was classmates with baseball pitcher Don Drysdale.[3][8] He described himself as having been a "bad" student, finding inspiration outside the classroom in art and sports.[3] He hit tennis balls with Pancho Gonzalez at the Los Angeles Tennis Club to help Gonzalez warm up for matches. Redford had a mild case of polio when he was 11.[9]</p> <br>
                <p class="p_Robert">After graduating from high school in 1954,[10] he attended the University of Colorado in Boulder for a year and a half,[3][11][12] where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.[13] While there, he worked at a restaurant/bar called The Sink, where a painting of his likeness now figures prominently among the bar's murals.[14][better source needed] While at Colorado, Redford began drinking heavily and, as a result, lost his half-scholarship and was expelled from school.[11][12] He went on to travel in Europe, living in France, Spain, and Italy.[3] He later studied painting at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and took classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (Class of 1959) in Manhattan, New York.[3][15]</p> <br>
